# ARKA Protocol: Executive Summary

**Compliance You Can Prove**

---

## What is ARKA?

ARKA (Provable Audit Compliance Trail) Protocol is a next-generation compliance operating system that combines deterministic rule evaluation, AI-enhanced pattern detection, and blockchain-anchored audit trails to deliver unprecedented compliance assurance.

**In one sentence:** ARKA finds hidden compliance risks that traditional systems miss and proves you found them.

## The Market Problem

Financial institutions face a compliance crisis:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Rising regulatory complexity** | 200+ rule changes per day across jurisdictions |
| **Examination pressure** | Average consent order: $50M; exam prep takes weeks |
| **False positive fatigue** | 35% false positive rates burn analyst time |
| **Hidden risk exposure** | Sophisticated violations slip through siloed systems |
| **Audit defensibility** | "Show me the evidence" is getting harder to answer |

**The gap:** Current compliance technology was built for a simpler era. It can't keep up.
