**ARKA Systems LLC**
**Series A Investment Memorandum**
**December 2024**

---

## Slide 1: Title

# ARKA Protocol

### The World's First AI-Supervised Compliance Operating System

**Deterministic Execution. Blockchain Attestation. Intelligent Analysis.**

*Building the compliance infrastructure for the next century of finance.*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Compliance is Broken

**$37.1 Billion** spent annually on AML compliance in the U.S. alone

**95%** of compliance alerts are false positives

**18 Months** average time to resolve regulatory investigations

**$2.3 Billion** in sanctions penalties issued in 2023

### The Root Cause

Current systems are:
- **Non-deterministic:** Same transaction can produce different outcomes
- **Mutable:** Audit trails can be modified after the fact
- **Reactive:** No predictive intelligence
- **Siloed:** No cross-institution coordination

**There is no source of truth for compliance.**

   - Bedrock integration with cryptographic provenance

### Regulatory Moat

4. **Government Relationships**
   - Active engagement with FinCEN, OFAC, OCC
   - $50M pilot proposal in procurement review
   - Regulatory endorsement creates insurmountable barrier

### Economic Moat

5. **One-Command Deployment**
   - 10x faster than any competitor
   - Infrastructure-as-code = massive scaling margins
   - Traditional vendors require 12-18 month implementations
